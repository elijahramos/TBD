# TBD
also our website is funniiboiz.ddns.net hosted by kevin's means. you can also login to the server via ssh, under the user "ubuntu" HOWEVER you need the key to do that, kevin has the key so if you want it you will need to get it from him safely (he wont email it to you). another thing I can do for you is create a sudo-able user for you but you will need to generate some RSA keys first for the computer you will use to SSH with. if you can do that, give me the public key (.pub file) and I can get the rest sorted out hopefully. (remeber DONT LOSE YOUR PRIVATE KEY)
