also our website is funniiboiz.ddns.net hosted by kevin's means. you can also login to the server via ssh, under the user "ubuntu" HOWEVER you need the key to do that, kevin has the key so if you want it you will need to get it from him safely (he wont email it to you). another thing I can do for you is create a sudo-able user for you but you will need to generate some RSA keys first for the computer you will use to SSH with. if you can do that, give me the public key (.pub file) and I can get the rest sorted out hopefully (remember DONT LOSE YOUR PRIVATE KEY). git edit, so what I can do is I can use "git clone <url of our git>" to make a working repository of this git. then I can use "git add <filename>" to add files to the index. then use "git commit -m 'msg'" to commit them to the HEAD. and then finally use "git push origin master" to basically save changes to our git repository. and then use "git pull" to get the current state of the git repository onto some other directory I have.
